## Installation
Installation and starting the problem will vary from person to person. There is no one language that someone uses therefore anyone can use any language and compile and run the answer file.

#### Example:
If we take a look at some of my solution, I solved the solution using java. In order to run java, you would first,

##### Compile the file by running:
```
$ javac filename.java
```

##### Then run the compiled file by running:
```
$ java filename
```

Below are just some checklist for me to see what I have finished :)
